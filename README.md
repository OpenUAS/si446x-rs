# Si446x Driver

_An embedded_hal driver for the Si446x family by Silicon Labs_

## Status

This is alpha code that I wrote for my own needs. It is in active development and works for basic
packet-based communication with an initialization vector generated by SiLabs WDS. PRs welcome.

## Docs

I'm going to put them up soon, for the time being use cargo doc.
